        A fire may occur anywhere, and it is critical to always be prepared for what you would do if one occurred in your house. Similarly, it's critical to consider all of the methods you can avoid one from occurring in the first place. 
		You want to know how to avoid fire in your house in order to safeguard it and the people you care about. Of course, there are the more apparent items you can purchase to safeguard your house from fire, such as smoke detectors, fire extinguishers, an escape plan, and even fireproof safe deposit boxes to preserve your possessions.</i></p>
		<p>
		Yet, there are some very basic precautions you might be doing to keep yourself safer, and if you start right now, you may be able to avoid an issue from occurring.</p>

			<td><i>Because of its early warning capacity, smoke detectors are your first line of protection against fire. They're now plugged into houses to monitor smoke and carbon monoxide levels and send notifications to your smart devices.

If you're using a battery-powered one, it's a good idea to check it every six months to determine if it's still functional. It only needs pressing a button on your alarm clock. A feeble beep indicates that it is necessary to replace the batteries as soon as possible. A WiFi-connected alarm, on the other hand, will notify you to change the batteries by sending an alert to your phone.</i></td>

			<td><i>According to the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), heating equipment is the leading cause of house fires in the United States. The problem is that faulty heating sources such as space heaters, central heating systems, and fireplaces can start a fire if ignored or left unattended. As a result, a yearly expert checkup is required to keep them operating securely and properly.

Simultaneously, you may do preventative maintenance such as cleaning the air filters at regular intervals. If you use a space heater, keep it away from combustible things. These little nuances are crucial when considering how trash and dust can cause fires when they become too close to a heat source.</i></td>

			<td><i>If your stove catches fire, it may not be your fault. Alternatively, it's possible that the culprit is food particles that have collected at the bottom of the burner. If you fail to clear the accumulation in your oven, the same thing might happen.

Now that you know what might happen if you leave food on these kitchen gadgets, make careful to clean them after each use. Cooktops and gas stoves, in particular, should be cleaned after use. Meanwhile, newer ovens include a self-cleaning option that you may use every few months.</i></td>
